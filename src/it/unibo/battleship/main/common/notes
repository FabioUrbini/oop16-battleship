TODO JUnit tests
TODO: Console game:
TODO: Boundaries / Control (create fleet, create shoot, ...)
TODO. rewrite better hashcode + equals + toString (use Guava library)
TODO: make a boundary interface + instance. Refactor methods

Consider Chain of Responsibility Pattern for shooting :
    Field, FieldCell, Fleet, Ship involved.


There can be more boundaries in a game. Make Ruleset control one
Ship direction -> standard = EAST. implement switchDirection method
Artificial Intelligence -> factory for shots. Use lambda for simple ones

There must be a Boundary only (?), handled by the Ruleset.
Consider refactoring

KISS,
DRY,
SOLID,
COMPOSITION > INHERITANCE
design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it
package -> by feature (not by layer)
